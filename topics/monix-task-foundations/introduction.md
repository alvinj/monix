## Monix

// TODO WRITE INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Monix course!

[Monix](https://monix.io/) Task is a data type for controlling possibly lazy & asynchronous computations.
Within a composable, high-level API, one can find many features related to error handling, concurrency, cancellation, and resource safety, among others.

During the course, we will start from nothing and learn how to use a `Task` and how it could be useful in real-life applications.

## Structure of the Course

Each lesson provides an overview of the given concept.

At the end of each lesson, there are exercises that you can solve to improve your understanding of the topic.
There are two types of them:
- Quiz questions supported by ScalaZone platform
- Coding exercises in the separate repository

Every few topics, there is a bigger coding task that is meant to combine newly acquired knowledge to solve a use case, 
that will give us a much better idea of how everything fits together and could be used in real projects.

### Instructions for coding exercises
// TODO ADD MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS

Since the platform does not (yet!) support coding exercises, we need to fork the following repository:
- https://github.com/scalazone/monix-exercises

The repository includes all the exercises, their solutions and unit tests that your solution should pass.

# Throughout the course, questions will appear at the bottom of each lesson, to test whether you have understood the concepts in the lesson.

Some of these require you to select a single answer. So try this with an easy question now: choose the language
you would like to learn.

- [ ] F#
- [ ] Haskell
- [X] Scala
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] C#

# Other questions allow you to choose multiple answers.

These are usually harder because, in order to get the question right, you must consider each and every possible
answer. Try this one now: select every programming language containing the letter `a` in its name.

* [ ] F#
* [X] Haskell
* [X] Scala
